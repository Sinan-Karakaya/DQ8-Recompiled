# DQ8Recomp

An experimental native port of **Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King**
for PlayStation 2, built with [PS2Recomp](https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp).
The game's MIPS code is translated to C++ locally and linked to a runtime that
implements the PS2 services it uses. Graphics use SDL3 GPU or a software reference
renderer.

**This is a development project, not a finished port.** The NTSC-U version
(`SLUS_212.07`) boots, loads saves, and reaches field gameplay. Sustained playable
performance, sound, and full-game compatibility are still in progress. The PAL
configuration is incomplete.

## Getting started

You need your own lawfully obtained game dump. This repository provides tools,
runtime code, and configuration; it does not provide the game, a BIOS, or a
prebuilt game executable.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Sinan-Karakaya/DQ8-Recompiled.git
cd DQ8-Recompiled
```

Follow the [build guide](https://github.com/Sinan-Karakaya/DQ8-Recompiled/wiki/Building)
to generate the game code and build the runtime. A default CMake build produces a
launcher stub, not the game.
